# Video-Playlist-Website
Project to fetch a playlist from Youtube and play it on website.

This is my very first project that I am posting on GitHub. The goal of this project is to build a website that takes a link to a Youtube playlist and embeds the videos on my website.

I am creating this website because I have a need for a website that simply is just for playing Youtube playlists. When Youtube switches videos it loads a new page, which then makes my computer slow down for a bit. The goal of this website is a very clean and simple video player so that it does not have a heavy load on the computer. Making this perfect for running in the background.
